AI is incredibly powerful right now, the fututre is now.

It is capable of dosens of different intelectual taskes: drawing, mimicing human and even non-human voice, text corrections, programming problems solving,
video creation, and even free talknig.

Obviosly some of it's capabilities are limited, but some are incredible. For example it's voice mimicing is absurdly good, I haven't been able to differentiate
human and AI. (about other taskes)

Some people are thinking that future from the 'Terminator' is a future of AI development. Maybe, AI may somehow overhrow the world. But, I think that that in
the near-future Ai will instead create a lack of jobs: artists, music composers, voice actors, etc.

You may be thinking that your job is safe, but that is probably just a matter of time and people thoughts. What are you thinking about self-driving cars?
Or about the fact that some models are already better at finding medical treatment than typecal doctors?

The only thing which I can say for sure is that future is now.
